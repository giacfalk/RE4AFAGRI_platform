 ## By the end of may

- Crop model: dynamic groundwater recharge constraint
- Make it multi time-step: not a piece of cake... (riprendere da load scenario_zambia.R)
- Test MLED replication without errors on UNIVE PC (that all files, packages, functions are there) -> also that results for baseline year 2020 are produced correctly
- Fix bug that monthly PerHHD only refers to newly electrified -> bug is carried over to other_productive
- Clean code, variable names, etc. in all scripts (make it more human-readable and commented) and files in the database (names, folders structure etc.)
- Rerun uploader script
- Send to beta testers
- Send outputs to Adriano

# First half of June

- Adjust all parameters and assumptions based on focus group discussions -> Notes 12.1 [ADE's work]
- Check data inputs are the best possible (and consistent with other modules) -> Greg 12.3
- Run scenarios for the future
    WaterCrop -> water demand (RCPS) [MARTA]
    groundwater recharge -> climate change (RCPS) [ISIMIP]
    socio-econoic development  (SSPs) [ISIMIP]
    (crop change -> but would need to first feed it into WaterCrop...)

 ## December  - January 2023 timeline
