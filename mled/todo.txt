# Mid August to November timeline
 - Modulate growth of mining demand

 - What to do with remote cropland -> currently excluded from all analysis. Consider what cropland (near/remote/both to include in solar pumps and welfare analysis)
- Downscaling cropland -> mmmmh
- Adjust all parameters and assumptions based on focus group discussions -> Notes 12.1 [ADE's work]
- Check data inputs are the best possible (and consistent with other modules) -> Greg 12.3
- Run scenarios for the future
    WaterCrop -> water demand (RCPS) [MARTA]
    groundwater recharge -> climate change (RCPS) [ISIMIP]
    socio-econoic development  (SSPs) [ISIMIP]
    (crop change -> but would need to first feed it into WaterCrop...)
- Enable output_hourly_resolution option in all scripts
